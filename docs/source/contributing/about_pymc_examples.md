# About PyMC-Examples
The example gallery is a key part of the PyMC documentation.
It is permanently evolving and there generally isn't anyone
or any team reviewing the content, making sure there are no duplicated
notebooks or that all relevant topics are covered...
It instead is a collection of community written resources
without much content planning involved.

However, while the notebook topics and content in each notebook
hasn't really been planned. The structure of the website,
the notebook pages and its sections _have been discussed at length
before deciding on the current style_.
This page explains the rationale behind pymc-examples and the {ref}`jupyter_style`.

Part of the content here is also covered in the [Contributing to PyMC Documentation
